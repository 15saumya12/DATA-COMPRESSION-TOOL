#DESCRIPTION#

TASK:- TO WRITE A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT A BASIC DATA COMPRESSION ALGORITHM LIKE RLE.

RLE COMPRESSION TOOL:-

The RLE Compression Tool is a simple command-line application that compresses and decompresses text files using Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

FEATURES:-

1. Compression: Compresses text files by replacing sequences of identical characters with a single character and a count of the number of times it appears in the sequence.
2. Decompression: Decompresses compressed text files by replacing each character and count with the original sequence of characters.
3. File Input/Output: Supports reading and writing text files.

USAGE:-

1. Compile the tool using gcc rle_tool.c -o rle_tool.
2. Run the tool using ./rle_tool.
3. Choose an option:
    - Compress a file (Option 1)
    - Decompress a file (Option 2)
    - Quit (Option 3)
4. Enter the input file path and output file path as prompted.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:-

1. Programming Language: C
2. Compression Algorithm: Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
3. File Format: Text files (.txt)

BENEFITS:-

1. Simple and Efficient: RLE is a simple and efficient compression algorithm that is easy to implement and understand.
2. Fast Compression and Decompression: RLE compression and decompression are fast operations that can be performed quickly, even on large files.
3. Low Memory Requirements: The RLE Compression Tool has low memory requirements, making it suitable for use on systems with limited memory.
